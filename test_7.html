            <h3>What Mary Oliver's Critics Don't Understand</h3>
            <h2>For America's most beloved poet, paying attentionto nature is a springbroard to the sacred.</h2>

                <p>"Mary Oliver is saving my life," Paul Chowder, the title character of Nicholson Baker's novel 
                    "<a href="#">The Anthologist</a>," scrawls in the margins of Oliver's "<a href="#"> New and 
                        Selected Poems, Volume One</a>." A struggling poet, Chowder is suffering from a severe case
                    of writer's block. His girlfriend, with whom he;s lived for eight years, has just left him,
                    ostensibly because he has been unable to write the long-overdue introduction to a poetry anthology
                    that he has been putting together. For solace and inspiration, he turns to poets who have been
                        his touchstones-Louise Bogan, Theodore Roethke, Sara Teasdale-before discovering Oliver. In her work,
                    he finds consolation:"I immediately felt more sure of what I was doing." Of her poems, he say,"They're
                        very simple. And yet each has something."</p>
                <p class="p2">I don't know exactly what a prayer is.<br>I do know how to pay attention, how to fall down<br>
                    into the grass, how to knell down in the grass,<br>how to be idle and blessed, how stroll through th 
                    fields,<br>which is what I have been doing all day</p>
                <p>The cadences are almost Biblical."Attention is the beginning of devotion," she urges elsewhere.</p>
